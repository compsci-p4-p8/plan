Ideal Technologies
- Next.js (React)
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase for db + auth
- Host on vercel or cloudflare pages

This one is the best because we dont have to setup auth or manage the db and it allows us to focus on just the site. its also the best for online tools like this.

For learning i would recomend https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites
and once done with that do: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/introduction-to-javascript/exercises/intro
